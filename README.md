# PVCDoric RailwayAnalyse (LACMTA) V0.5

## About V0.5

RailwayAnalyse by PVCDoric is the prototype version of a customisable tool which gets information about railways from JSON files to display the information in a presentable user-centred manner. Version 0.5 includes sample information from LACMTA's Metro Rail: an urban railway in Los Angeles. Future versions will include both line and station information.

## Technologies Used

The three technologies used for this project are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The normalise CSS file was included. The version using 'Bootstrap' was not selected for the final product because it led to slower loading times and included too many CSS defaults which needed resetting.

Note: The version using 'Bootstrap' is accessible at github.com/DelacorteClock/UserInterfaceLibraryProject and delacorteclock.github.io/UserInterfaceLibraryProject
